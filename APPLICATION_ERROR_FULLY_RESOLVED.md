## ðŸ”§ **ROOT CAUSE & SOLUTION**

### **Problem Identified**

The application errors were caused by complex client-side components that had:

- **Browser API Dependencies**: Voice recognition and advanced state management
- **Hydration Mismatches**: Complex components not rendering consistently between server and client
